# Image Format Conversion Program

This is a simple Python program that converts JPG images to PNG format.

## Description

The program takes two command-line arguments: the source folder path and the destination folder path. It converts all the JPG images found in the source folder to PNG format and saves them in the destination folder.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (PIL)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

Make sure to replace `/path/to/source_folder` and `/path/to/destination_folder` with the actual paths to the source and destination folders, respectively.
