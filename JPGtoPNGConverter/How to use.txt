#This program will convert jpg images to png automatically. This will save you a lot of time because you don't have to open each images in Photoshop and convert each image there. 

Steps in using the python script:
Make sure you have python Installed on your computer.


Make sure to run this script with the source folder path and destination folder path as command-line arguments, like this:

#This is the command that you have to enter in the terminal for the program to run
python script.py /path/to/source_folder /path/to/destination_folder


Replace /path/to/source_folder and /path/to/destination_folder with the actual folder paths in your case.
